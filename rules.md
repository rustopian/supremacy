# Supremacy: Comprehensive Rules and Gameplay Guide

Welcome to **Supremacy**, a strategic board game where you lead a corporation in the high-stakes race to achieve quantum supremacy. Navigate technological advancements, corporate culture development, qubit technologies, and ethical dilemmas as you compete to shape the future of quantum computing. Your decisions will determine not only your corporation's fate but potentially the destiny of the world.

## Game Overview

- **Players:** 2-5
- **Objective:** Lead your corporation to quantum supremacy by advancing your Quantum Computer Board while managing corporate culture, navigating qubit limitations imposed by the Laws of Physics, forming alliances, and preventing an AI-driven dystopia.
- **Phases:** The game is divided into two phases:
  1. **Phase 1:** Development, qubit technology advancement, and corporate culture formation.
  2. **Phase 2:** The intensified race for dominance or cooperative victory, where corporations may continue advancing quantum technology, unlock powerful Quantum Advancements, and prevent a dystopian outcome.

## Components

### Game Board

- **Quantum Advancement Boards:** Becomes available when a player flips their Quantum Computer Board after filling all 6 Qubit slots.
- **Dystopia Track:** Measures the risk of AI and quantum technology spiraling out of control (range from 0 to 10).
- **Corporate Culture Board:** A shared board where all players' pawns track their positions along the Cooperation and Innovation axes (from -5 to +5, with 0 being neutral).

### Player Components

- **Corporate Identity Cards:** Each player has a unique corporation with:
  - **Starting Money:** Initial funds to perform actions (e.g., 5 Money).
  - **Employee Pawns:** Represent your workforce for standard actions (average of 3 per player).
  - **Agent Pawns:** Specialized operatives for advanced actions (average of 1 per player).
  - **Qubit Type:** The specific quantum technology your corporation specializes in (assigned randomly from 8 types).

### Tokens and Cards

- **Money Tokens:** Currency used for various actions and investments.
- **Qubit Cubes:** Placed on Quantum Computer Boards to advance technology and gain minor powers.
- **Interference Cubes:** Represent errors and setbacks in quantum systems.
- **Strategy Cards:**
  - **Phase 1 Strategy Cards:** Used during Phase 1 for development and shaping corporate culture.
  - **Phase 2 Strategy Cards:** Used during Phase 2 for high-stakes actions against competitors and managing the Dystopia Track.
  - **Hire Cards:** Strategy Cards that can be played as ongoing hires, providing continuous benefits.
- **Laws of Physics Cards:** Hidden cards that, when revealed, prevent a specific qubit type from reaching quantum supremacy.
  - **Total of 16 cards** (2 per qubit type).

### Action Spaces

- Locations on the board where players place pawns to perform actions.

### Other Components

- **First Player Token:** Indicates the first player for each round.

## Setup

### Select Corporations
